This repository contains the code used for the simulation study and empirical illustration for my master's thesis (TFM: Trabajo de Fin de MÃ¡ster) in June 2025. The files are: 
- simulation.R: The simulation study structure.
- simulation_functions.R: All auxiliar functions used in the simulation and empirical studies. Note: "optimization()" is the one that uses each optimization algorithm for forced-choice questionnaire assembly!
- empirical_illustration.R: The empirical illustration structure that shows you how to assemble a forced-choice questionnaire from scratch. Note that this code does not account for polarity inversions.
- lib folder: Contains all Genetic Algorithm functions.

  Feel free to reach out for any questions or improvements at: scarlett.escudero@estudiante.uam.es
  Special thanks to: Miguel A. Sorrel, Francisco J. Abad, and Rodrigo S. Kreitchmann!
